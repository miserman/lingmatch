This example demonstrates a few ways to specify comparisons and groups in lingmatch.

*Built with R 
`r getRversion()`
on 
`r format(Sys.time(),'%B %d %Y')`*

***
# Setup

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  dev = "CairoSVG",
  fig.ext = "svg"
)
library(lingmatch)
```

We'll generate some word category output, in a sort of experimental design that allows for all available comparison types: 

Imagine in two studies we paired up participants, then had them have a series of interactions after reading one of a set of prompts:
```{r}
# load lingmatch
library('lingmatch')

# first, we have simple representations (function word category use frequencies)
# of our prompts (3 prompts per study):
prompts = data.frame(
  study = rep(paste('study', 1:2), each = 3),
  prompt = rep(paste('prompt', 1:3), 2),
  matrix(rnorm(3 * 2 * 7, 10, 4), 3 * 2, dimnames = list(NULL, names(lma_dict(1:7))))
)
prompts[1:5, 1:8]

# then, the same representation of the language the participants produced:
data = data.frame(
  study = sort(sample(paste('study', 1:2), 100, TRUE)),
  pair = sort(sample(paste('pair', formatC(1:20, width = 2, flag = 0)), 100, TRUE)),
  prompt = sample(paste('prompt', 1:3), 100, TRUE),
  speaker = sample(c('a', 'b'), 100, TRUE),
  matrix(rnorm(100 * 7, 10, 4), 100, dimnames = list(NULL, colnames(prompts)[-(1:2)]))
)
data[1:5, 1:8]
```

# Matching with a standard

## Sample means
Compare each row (here representing a turn in an conversation) with the sample's mean:
```{r}
# the `lsm` (Language Style Matching) type specifies the columns to consider,
# and the metric to use (Canberra similarity)
lsm_mean = lingmatch(data, mean, type = 'lsm')

# look at comparison information
lsm_mean[c('comp.type', 'comp')]

# and maybe the average similarity score
mean(lsm_mean$sim)
```

This could be considered a baseline for the sample.

## Stored means
These LSM categories have some standard means stored internally, as found in the [LIWC manual](https://liwc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LIWC2015_LanguageManual.pdf).
```{r}
# compare with means from a set of tweets
lsm_twitter = lingmatch(data, 'twitter', type = 'lsm')
lsm_twitter[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
mean(lsm_twitter$sim)

# or the means of the set that is most similar to the current set
lsm_auto = lingmatch(data, 'auto', type = 'lsm')
lsm_auto[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
mean(lsm_auto$sim)
```

## External means
If you have another set of data, you can also use its means as the comparison:
```{r}
lsm_prmed = lingmatch(data, colMeans(prompts[, -(1:2)]), type = 'lsm')
lsm_prmed[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
mean(lsm_prmed$sim)
```


## Group means
You can also compare to means within groups. Here, studies might be considered groups:
```{r}
lsm_topics = lingmatch(data, group = study, type = 'lsm')
lsm_topics[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
tapply(lsm_topics$sim[, 2], lsm_topics$sim[, 1], mean)
```

This type of group variable is just splitting the data, and performing the same comparisons within splits.

# Matching with other texts

The previous comparisons were all with standards, where the LSM score could be interpreted as indicating a more or less
generic language style (as defined by the comparison and grouping).

## Condition ID
Here, prompts constitute our experimental conditions. We have 3 unique prompt IDs, but 6 unique prompts, since each study had its own set, so we need the study and prompt ID to appropriately match prompts:
```{r}
lsm = lingmatch(data, prompts, group = c('study', 'prompt'), type = 'lsm')
lsm$comp.type
lsm$comp[, 1:6]
lsm$sim[1:10,]
```

Here, the `group` argument is just pasting together the included variables, and using the resulting string to identify a single comparison for each text (acting as a condition ID).

## Participant ID
Similarly, participants are only uniquely identified by pair ID and speaker ID (though this could just as well be a single column with unique IDs).
```{r}
interlsm = lingmatch(data, group = c('pair', 'speaker'), type = 'lsm')
interlsm$comp[1:10,]
interlsm$sim[1:10,]
```

# Matching in sequence
Since participants are having interactions in sequence, we might compare each turn in sequence. The last entry in the `group` argument specifies the speaker:
```{r}
seqlsm = lingmatch(data, 'seq', group = c('pair', 'speaker'), type = 'lsm')
seqlsm$sim[1:10,]
```
The rownames of `sim` show the row numbers that are being compared, with some being aggregated if the same speaker takes multiple turns in a row. You could also just compare edges by adding `agg = FALSE`:
```{r}
lingmatch(
  data, 'seq', group = c('pair', 'speaker'), type = 'lsm', agg = FALSE
)$sim[1:10,]
```
