<h2>Latent Semantic Space Operations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate and reduce the singular value decomposition of a dtm (i.e., create a latent semantic
space), or map a dtm onto an existing latent semantic space.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
lma_lspace(dtm, space, path = paste0(path.package("lingmatch"), "/data"),
  dim.cutoff = 0.5, keep.dim = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dtm</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix with terms as column names.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>space</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of right singular vectors (a latent semantic space), with terms as
rownames. If missing, this will be calculated from the <code>dtm</code>. If a character, a file
matching the character will be searched for in the lingmatch data folder (e.g.,
<code>space = 'default'</code>). If the file has a .sqlite extension, it will be only a subset will
be loaded into RAM; this is slightly slower than using a full, preloaded .rda space, but faster
than loading and unloading a complete .rda space, and less RAM intensive in all cases.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path to a folder containing spaces. If not included, spaces will be looked for in the
lingmatch data folder (<code>paste0(path.package('lingmatch'),'/data')</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dim.cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>If a <code>space</code> is calculated, this will be used to decide on the number of
dimentions to be retained: <code>cumsum(d) / sum(d) &lt; dim.cutoff</code>, where <code>d</code> is a vector
of singular values of <code>dtm</code> (i.e., <code>svd(dtm)$d</code>). The default is <code>.5</code>; lower
cutoffs result in fewer dimensions.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.dim</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical: if <code>TRUE</code> and a space is being calculated from the input, a matrix
in the same dimentions as <code>dtm</code> is returned. Otherwise, a matrix with terms as rows and
svd dimentions as columns is returned. The default, truncated matrix</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>A general latent semantic space is a selection of right singluar vectors from the singular value
decompositon of a dtm (<code>svd(dtm)$v[,1:k]</code>, where <code>k</code> is the selected number of
dimentions, decided here by <code>cutoff</code>).
</p>
<p>Mapping a new dtm into a latent semantic space consists of multiplying common terms:
<code>dtm[,ct] %*% space[ct,]</code>, where <code>ct = colnames(dtm)[colnames(dtm) %in%
rownames(space)]</code> &ndash; the terms common between the dtm and the space. This results in a matrix
with documents as rows, and svd dimensions as columns, replacing terms.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

text = c(
  "Hey, I like kittens. I think all kinds of cats really are just the best pet ever.",
  "Oh year? Well I really like cars. All the wheels and the turbos... I think that's the best
    ever.",
  "You know what? Poo on you. Cats, dogs, rabbits -- you know, living creatures... to think
     you'd care about anything else!",
  "You can stick to your opinion. You can be wrong if you want. You know what life's about?
    Supercharging, diesel guzzling, exhaust spewing, piston moving ignitions."
)

dtm = lma_dtm(text)

#using a space from a file might look something like this:
# lma_space(dtm,'default.zip','C:/user/name/downloads')

#calculate a latent semantic space from the example text
lss = lma_lspace(dtm)

#show that document similarities between the truncated and full space are the same
spaces = list(
  full = lma_lspace(dtm,keep.dim=TRUE),
  truncated = lma_lspace(dtm,lss)
)
sapply(spaces,lma_simets,metric='cosine')
