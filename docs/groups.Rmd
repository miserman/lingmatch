This example demonstrates a few ways to specify comparisons and groups in lingmatch.

*Built with R 
`r getRversion()`
on 
`r format(Sys.time(),'%B %d %Y')`*

***
# Setup

We'll use texts from a study which had participants responding to a few prompts.
```{r}
# load lingmatch
library('lingmatch')

# download prompt and response data
prompts = read.csv('https://osf.io/xm6ew/?action=download')
responses = read.csv('https://osf.io/crgkn/?action=download')

# for now, we'll just look at one of the studies included in the set
responses = responses[responses$Study == 4,]
```

# Matching with a standard

## Sample means
The simplest type of LSM we can look at is LSM with the overall mean; each participant's LSM categories are
compared with the average of all participants' LSM categories:
```{r}
# since this file includes LIWC output, we can just enter the whole frame
lsm_mean = lingmatch(responses, type = 'lsm')

# or we could process the raw text in the same way
lsm_mean_raw = lingmatch(responses$Text, type = 'lsm')

# these will be a little different due to differences in
# function word dictionaries and text processing between LIWC and lingmatch
cor(lsm_mean$sim, lsm_mean_raw$sim)
```

The `sim` component of the lingmatch output has the actual LSM scores,
but the comparison is also stored in the lingmatch output:
```{r}
lsm_mean[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
```

This type of LSM might be interpreted as a sort of generic matching; that is, how similar a given text is
to the set of texts. Similar comparisons can be made to standards other than the current set's mean, such
as the mean of other sets.

## Stored means
The LIWC manual includes the means of a few sets of texts, which can be manually or automatically specified:
```{r}
# compare with means from a set of novels
lsm_novels = lingmatch(responses, 'novels', type = 'lsm')
lsm_novels[c('comp.type', 'comp')]

# or the means of the set that is most similar to the current set
lsm_auto = lingmatch(responses, 'auto', type = 'lsm')
lsm_auto[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
```

## External means
If you have another set of data, you can also use its means as the comparison:
```{r}
lsm_prmed = lingmatch(responses, prompts, type = 'lsm')
lsm_prmed[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
```


## Group means
You can also compare to means within groups. This set, for example, had prompts of different topics,
so we might look at LSM with the means of these groups:
```{r}
lsm_topics = lingmatch(responses, group = Topic, type = 'lsm')
lsm_topics[c('comp.type', 'comp')]
```

These LSM scores might be interpreted as similarity to the texts of those who saw prompts with the same topic.

This sort of grouping might be called splitting because it's performing the same operation, just independently within splits (always comparing each text to the mean of all texts within the split).
So the `group` argument is just specifying how to split the data.

The other type of grouping applicable to this data uses the `group` argument more like a set of IDs -- it pairs texts
to specific other texts.

# Matching with other texts

The previous comparisons were all with standards, where the LSM score could be interpreted as indicating a more or less
generic language style (as defined by the comparison and grouping). What's often more interesting is to look at
matching between individual texts.

## Condition ID
The data we're using had participants responding to a particular prompt, so we can look at
matching between the participant's response and the prompt they are responding to:
```{r}
lsm = lingmatch(responses, prompts, group = c('Study', 'Topic', 'Style'), type = 'lsm')
lsm$sim[1:10,]
```

Here, the `group` argument is just pasting together the included variables, and using the resulting string to identify a single comparison for each text (acting as a condition ID).

## Participant ID
This study also collected two responses from each participant, so we might look at LSM between their prompts:
```{r}
interlsm = lingmatch(responses, 'pair', group = ParticipantID, type = 'lsm')
interlsm$sim[1:10,]
```

Here, the `comp` argument (that in the second position) is specifying a pairwise comparison; within levels of
`ParticipantID`, each text will be compared. If there are more than two texts within a level, the scores
will be averaged, but in this case the LSM scores are just the similarity between the participant's two responses.

If `comp` was a function (such as `mean`, the default), each prompt would be compared the to mean of the
participant's responses.

Either of these might be interpreted as a measure of self-consistency in language style, with lower scores
potentially indicating more sensitivity, or greater matching with other language sources. That is, if
inter-LSM scores are very high, differences in LSM with other sources may mean less; they may speak more
to how similar that other source happened to be to the participant's default language style, rather than
how much the participant is actively matching to that source.
